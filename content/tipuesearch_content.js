The most common cases are mid-size or mini-towers, while some people, mostly gamers, still like full-sized towers. Some cases are made in a small form factor (SFF) to be easily carried for portability or to match an entertainment system like a DVD player in size. Servers are often contained in very long and narrow cases that usually range in size from one unit tall (a few inches) to two units tall (about 6-8 inches). Each of these cases provide us with a distinct layout of the motherboard they will accept. This layout is called a form factor. Larger case sizes allow for additional devices (such as hard disk drives and optical drives). The type of case will depend on the customer’s needs. \n \n Tower case.

The ATX form factor is one of the most widely used form factors in contemporary computers. It has been in use since the 1990s. The ATX form factor contains a rear port cluster for its integrated ports (audio, video, sound, network, etc.). The expansion slots run parallel to the short side of the board, and the cases have a left-side case opening to support easily adding expansion cards. \n \n ATX form factor motherboard.

The expansion slots run parallel to the short side of the board, and the cases have a left-side case opening to support easily adding expansion cards. \n As shown in the table below, there are many variations of the ATX form factor, with the main difference being the physical size of the board and the number of expansion slots. Bigger boards allow for additional expansion slots, but require a larger tower. \n \n The ITX form factor was created in 2001. The ITX form factor itself was not very popular, but a variant called the mini-ITX became quite popular, since it also fit into ATX-style cases. It also contains a rear port cluster for its integrated ports (audio, video, sound, network, etc.). The expansion slots run parallel to the short side of the board, and the cases have a left-side case opening to support easily adding expansion cards, just like the ATX boards. Smaller variations, called pico-ITX and nano-ITX, are often used in computing appliances such as smart televisions, Internet-connected set-top devices designed to integrate with TV sets, and others. \n \n Small form factor motherboard.
